### üöÄ Projects

#### 1. Safety & Accessibility

Projects aimed at ensuring human safety and improving quality of life.

* **Development of a White Cane Detection AI Model**

  * **Objective:** To detect white canes used by visually impaired individuals in real-time from camera footage within train stations, with the goal of enabling early assistance.

  * **Responsibilities:** Dataset creation, selection, training, and evaluation of the object detection model.

* **Development of a Long-Range Fall Detection AI**

  * **Objective:** To develop an AI that detects falls from small and unclear video footage, intended for application in public spaces.

  * **Responsibilities:** Designed and implemented an object detection model tailored for fall detection.

* **Nighttime Person Detection using Drones and Thermal Imaging**

  * **Objective:** To develop a system for detecting people at night from thermal camera footage captured by drones.

  * **Responsibilities:** Designed and implemented a camera footage acquisition function using a drone SDK. Responsible for dataset creation, and the selection, training, and evaluation of the object detection model.

* **Development of Posture Evaluation Software**

  * **Objective:** To extract human skeletal information from camera footage in real-time to quantitatively evaluate and provide feedback on movement and posture.

  * **Responsibilities:** GUI design, integration with a pose estimation API, and implementation of the evaluation logic.

#### 2. Business Efficiency

Projects that contributed to improving the productivity of development tasks.

* **Similar Damage Image Retrieval AI for Highways**

  * **Objective:** To develop an AI that rapidly searches a vast database of past cases for similar images of road surface damage taken during highway inspections.

  * **Responsibilities:** Dataset creation, selection, training, and evaluation of the image retrieval model. Also responsible for GUI design.

* **Annotation Efficiency Improvement for Panoptic Segmentation using LLMs**

  * **Objective:** To semi-automate and streamline the annotation process for Panoptic Segmentation, which simultaneously identifies objects and backgrounds in images, by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs).

  * **Responsibilities:** Dataset creation. Selection and evaluation of semantic and instance segmentation models.

#### 3. Software & Feature Development

* **Addition of Wake Word Functionality to Speech Recognition AI**

  * **Objective:** To implement a speech recognition function that activates upon detecting a specific trigger word (wake word).

  * **Responsibilities:** Integration of the wake word detection model and tuning of its recognition accuracy.

* **Creation of a Synthetic Data Editing Tool**

  * **Objective:** To develop an internal tool for efficiently creating and editing synthetic data (fake data) to augment AI training datasets.

  * **Responsibilities:** GUI implementation.
